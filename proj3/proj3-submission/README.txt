File Descriptions:

main.py: 

This is where I prototyped and eventually ran my work. I have some functions defined here for convenience, but I mostly used this for running my functions defined elsewhere and displaying results.

julians_little_helpers.py:

This file has all working code behind the project. Has computeAffine(), morph() and others utilities.
