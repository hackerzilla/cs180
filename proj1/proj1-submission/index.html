		The result of your algorithm on all of our example images. List the offsets you calculated. Do not turn in the
		large .tiff images. Your web page should only display compressed images (e.g. jpg or png or gif if you want to
		animate something).

		The result of your algorithm on a few examples of your own choosing, downloaded from the Prokudin-Gorskii
		collection.

		If your algorithm failed to align any image, provide a brief explanation of why.

		Remember not to use any absolute links to images etc on your computer, as these will not work online. Only use
		relative links within your folder.

	<h3>
		Overview
	</h3>
	<p>
		My approach was relatively straightforward, although I learned a massive amount from this project and I would do
		it differently if I were to do it again.

		I first familiarized myself with the basics by learning how to read in and display images, followed by cropping,
		compositing and saving images.

		It took me longer than I would like to admit to figure out how to translate images in the compositing process
		without getting indexing errors relating to going out of bounds.

		Even to this day my code has bugs in regards to out of bounds indices, if the gaussian tree depth is too great
		(I keep it to around 1/8 scale).
	</p>
	<p>
		After achieving translation and compositing, I tackled the alignment search. My approach was overly
		straightforward. At first I made a lot of mistakes related to black values of pixels on the outside of the image
		which skewed the Sum of Squared Differences scores. I resorted to implementing Normalized Cross Correlation,
		which was much easier and more effective than SSD. Eventually, I also realized that cropping the second image
		(the green or red one) before running NCC solved many of my issues, and suddenly my allignment algorithm worked
		flawlessly--at least for .jpg images. It was far too slow for .tif pictures because they required a much broader
		search range which exponentially incrased the work required for alignment search.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next up was attempting to solve the complexity issues with a gaussian pyramid for alignment search. This was
		much trickier than expected. Currently I have the pyramid working, although it is not as fast as I would have
		hoped for, and there are the indexing bugs I mentioned earlier related to the array bounds becoming too small to
		search. The hardest part of this project was in understanding the concepts behind what I was supposed to
		implement, and then also debugging my code, especially as it related to the indexing issues. Wrapping my head
		around one image being "slid" across another image, and thinking about when it goes "off the edge" was very
		difficult.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the end, my gaussian pyramid worked after many rehashed attempts at the algorithm. I found that the simplest
		approach worked best and I didn't need that many levels of recursion.
	</p>

	<h3>
		Difficult Images
	</h3>
	<p>
		I had a hard time getting 'emir', 'melons' and 'self_portrait' to align well. Especially emir. I believe the
		cause is that there is not much overlap between bright portions of the red/green/blue color channels in these
		photos. In other words, they have a lot of one color in large swathes, like emir's bright blue clothes, and the
		very green melons. Overall, I'm still happy with what I achieved, given how much I struggled with this project,
		but I could have improved these three images if I had time to implement a more sophisticated pattern recognition
		method.
