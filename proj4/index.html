        <h2>Shoot the Pictures</h2>
        <p>
            For my pictures I decided to use a tripod to take the pictures
            on the roof of the astronomy building. I think they turned out prety 
            well, except for the fact that I forgot to hold the exposure 
            constant.

        <h2>Warping the Images</h2>
        <p>
            Warping wasn't all that bad. It was similar to project 3's 
            triangle warp, except that I had to warp the entire image.
            It was a little tricky to figure out exactly how and where 
            to place the pixels using inverse warping, but eventually 
            I realized I could just use the skimage.draw.polygon() function
            just like with triangle warping in project 3, but this time 
            the polygon was the image warping to the other image.
        <br>
        <br>
            Here's my warped image with some (excessive) padding:

        <h2>Rectifcation</h2>
        <p>
            Didn't do this yet..
        </p>
        <h2>Blending the Mosaic</h2>
        <p>
            For blending the images, I found that an average of the overlapping
            region was sufficient for a good blend and laplacian stack blending
            as we did in project 2 didn't actually improve it at all.
            In addition, I experimented with using different correspondences
            to make the homography matrix. No matter what I did, I couldn't get
            that slight misalignment to go away. My hypothesis is that 
            implementing MOPS and RANSAC in part B of project 4 will fix this.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here's what the blended image looked like. As you can see, there's 
            a slight misalignment problem. I believe RANSAC and MOPS will solve
            this problem.

        <h2>What I learned...</h2>
        <p>
            I think the most important thing I've learned in this project is how easy it is to use 
            least squares to compute homographies. 
            It literally is as simple as doing the linear algebra and rearranging things slightly.
            <br><br>
            Also, this project really reinforced that writing clear code and thinking 
            straightfordwarly about the data structures is especially important in 
            these data heavy projects. This was also true in the previous ones, but 
            this project integrated all that we learned in the previous ones and 
            so keeping track of the arrays in your head was even more important.
            <br><br>
            Besides learning more about python/numpy data structures and linear algebra, I gained 
            an appreciation for the simplicity yet high potential of homographies. There's a lot 
            you can do with them, and I'm looking forward to using them for photogrammetry in the 
            upcoming projects.
