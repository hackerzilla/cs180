File Descriptions:

main.py: 

This is where I prototyped and eventually ran my work. I have some functions defined here for convenience, but I mostly used this for running my functions defined elsewhere and displaying results.

julians_little_helpers.py:

This file has some helper functions and old code I reused from project 3.
